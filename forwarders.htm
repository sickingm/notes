<h2>Mail Forwarders</h2></p><hr>
<p><u>How to update the email forwarder list.</u><blockquote>
	<p>
The file which cantains the list of email forwarders (also known as aliases) is stored 
in <code>/etc/valiases/sickingfamily.com</code>.
This file is not accessible via ftp or fopen within php, but is it accessible through system 
command (i.e., Linux commands on the server.)  So the process is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Delete existing aliases file, in php: <code>system("cp /dev/null /etc/valiases/sickingfamily.com");</code>.<br />
		This copies the standard Linux null file over the existing aliases file.  This is necessary to ensure 
		that any obsolete forwarders are removed from the list.
	</li>
	<li>
		Run <code>public_html/cron/forwarders/_cron_forwarders_create.php</code>.  <br />This will generate a
		file in that directory named <code>forwarders.txt</code> which will be used to replace the aliases file.
	</li>
	<li>
		Copy the newly created forwarders.txt file over the now empty aliases file.  
		To do this execute the following php system command:<br />
		<code>system("cp /home3/sickingf/public_html/cron/forwarders/forwarders.txt  /etc/valiases/sickingfamily.com")</code>
	</li>

</ol>
