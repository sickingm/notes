<b>How do I prevent XSS (cross-site scripting) using just HTML and PHP?</b><br />

Basically you need to use the function htmlspecialchars() whenever you want to output 
something to the browser that came from the user input.<br /><br />

The correct way to use this function is something like this:
<pre>
	echo htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
</pre>
